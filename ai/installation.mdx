Our AI system works on a Linux operating system, specially Ubuntu (24.04 or 22.04). Linux systems are faster and more efficient for AI-based object and activity detection due to their lightweight architecture, better memory management, and ability to optimize hardware performance, especially for GPU acceleration. Additionally, Linux offers better support for AI frameworks, lower latency in real-time processing, and greater stability for high-performance computing tasks. [It powers most of world's supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500).

We have customized a Ubuntu ISO with pre-installed dependencies for AI-based object, activity detection and Front end to work immediately. However, in some cases, manual installation may be required where a format is not possible or a freshly installed system is given.


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Customized Ubuntu ISO">

    This customized ISO is divided into 2 architectures: [with Nvidia](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and [without Nvidia](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) GPUs. You can download and follow these [instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) from your Windows machine to make it bootable and install to the client server, laptop or edge devices (excluding Jetson).
    <Note>
    Remember to disable Secure Boot in your BIOS for Nvidia driver to function correctly.
    </Note>

  <Tab title="2. Manual Installation">

    ## Manual Installation: On a fresh Ubuntu OS

    **Pre-condition**: You must know by now how to create a bootable Ubuntu ISO, disable secure boot in case of Nvidia GPUs and basic CLI usages.

    <Tip>
      Ubuntu has a good terminal built-in but Windows's command prompt is very basic, so please download [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). This has features of tabs, and supports more Linux native commands that will be useful when interacting with it.
    </Tip>

    ### Nvidia

    <Warning>
      Only do if you have Nvidia GPU. If you're not sure, then run the following command to check if Nvidia GPU is available and don't forget to disable Secure Boot in BIOS settings.
    </Warning>

    Update the device database and find if Nvidia GPU is available.

    ```bash
    sudo update-pciids && sudo lshw -C display
    ```

    #### Drivers

    If Nvidia GPU is available, then install the driver using the following commands.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    ubuntu-drivers devices
    sudo apt install nvidia-driver-560
    ```

    #### CUDA, CuDNN and TensorRT

    CUDA, CuDNN, and TensorRT are essential for accelerating deep learning on NVIDIA GPUsâ€”CUDA enables parallel computing, CuDNN optimizes neural network operations, and TensorRT enhances model inference speed with lower latency and higher efficiency.

    ```bash cuda
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.8.0/local_installers/cuda_12.8.0_570.86.10_linux.run
    chmod +x cuda_12.8.0_570.86.10_linux.run && sudo sh cuda_12.8.0_570.86.10_linux.run
    ```

    ```bash cudnn
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/redist/cudnn/linux-x86_64/cudnn-linux-x86_64-9.7.1.26_cuda12-archive.tar.xz
    tar -xf cudnn-linux-x86_64-9.7.1.26_cuda12-archive.tar.xz
    sudo mv -n cuda/include/* /usr/local/cuda/include/
    sudo mv -n cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
    ```

    ---

    ### One-file installation

    Run following commands to download `install.sh`[[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajc-msysindia/docs/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh)] file and install all the necessary libraries, python modules, make folders and give necessary permissions
    ```bash install.sh
    cd ~/Downloads && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajc-msysindia/docs/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh
    chmod u+x install.sh && ./install.sh
    ```

    For your understanding: What the script installs and it's explanation of separate components are given below.

    <Warning>
      If you're running the `install.sh`, then running commands of this section is not required if the `install.sh` installation went successfully. In case of failure, you can run the following commands separately.
