Our AI system works on a Linux operating system, specially Ubuntu (24.04 or 22.04). Linux systems are faster and more efficient for AI-based object and activity detection due to their lightweight architecture, better memory management, and ability to optimize hardware performance, especially for GPU acceleration. Additionally, Linux offers better support for AI frameworks, lower latency in real-time processing, and greater stability for high-performance computing tasks. [It powers most of world's supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500).

We have customized a Ubuntu ISO with pre-installed dependencies for AI-based object, activity detection and Front end to work immediately. However, in some cases, manual installation may be required where a format is not possible or a freshly installed system is given.


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bitbucket" title="Using customized Ubuntu ISO">
    This customized ISO is divided into 2 architectures: [with Nvidia](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and [without Nvidia](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) GPUs. You can download and follow these [instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) from your Windows machine to make it bootable and install to the client server, laptop or edge devices (excluding Jetson).
    <Note>
    Remember to disable Secure Boot in your BIOS for Nvidia driver to function correctly.
    </Note>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Manual installation">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 
    1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `docs.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
    <Note>
      If youâ€™re currently using the legacy ```mint.json``` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:


      ```npm i -g mintlify@latest```
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      ```mintlify upgrade```
      You should now be using the new ```docs.json``` configuration file. Feel free to delete the ```mint.json``` file from your repository.
    </Note>

## After fresh install of Ubuntu OS

**Pre-condition**: You must know by now how to create a bootable Ubuntu ISO, disable secura boot incase of Nvidia GPUs and basic CLI usages.

<Note>
  Ubuntu has a good terminal built-in. But Windows's command prompt is very basic, so please download [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). This has features of tabs, and supports more Linux native commands that will be useful when interacting with it.
</Note>

### Nvidia

<Warning>
  Only do if you have Nvidia GPU. If you're not sure, then run the following command to check if Nvidia GPU is available.
</Warning>

Update the device database and find if Nvidia GPU is available.

```bash
sudo update-pciids && sudo lshw -C display
```

#### Drivers

If Nvidia GPU is available, then install the driver using the following commands.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
ubuntu-drivers devices
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-560
```

#### CUDA, CuDNN and TensorRT

CUDA, CuDNN, and TensorRT are essential for accelerating deep learning on NVIDIA GPUsâ€”CUDA enables parallel computing, CuDNN optimizes neural network operations, and TensorRT enhances model inference speed with lower latency and higher efficiency.

```bash cuda
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.8.0/local_installers/cuda_12.8.0_570.86.10_linux.run
chmod +x cuda_12.8.0_570.86.10_linux.run && sudo sh cuda_12.8.0_570.86.10_linux.run
```

```bash cudnn
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/redist/cudnn/linux-x86_64/cudnn-linux-x86_64-9.7.1.26_cuda12-archive.tar.xz
tar -xf cudnn-linux-x86_64-9.7.1.26_cuda12-archive.tar.xz
sudo mv -n cuda/include/* /usr/local/cuda/include/
sudo mv -n cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
```

### One-file installation

Download `install.sh` [script](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) file. Put the file in `~/Downloads` folder, run following commands and it will install all the necessary libraries, python modules, make folders and give necessary permissions
```bash install.sh
cd ~/Downloads && chmod u+x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Even though the above script installs everything, for your understanding only explaination of separate component inside this script are written below.

<Warning>
  If you're running the `install.sh`, then running commands of this section is not required.
</Warning>

#### System Libraries

These commands install essential development libraries, compilers, and dependencies for AI-based applications on Ubuntu, including tools for building software, media processing, GUI development, networking, and hardware interaction. They ensure a fully equipped environment for compiling and running AI models efficiently.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl git git-lfs
sudo apt-get install -y cmake build-essential zsh neovim yasm ripgrep parallel openssh-server autossh net-tools patchelf ccache
sudo apt-get install -y libgl1 libgtk-3-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev libx264-dev libx265-dev

sudo apt-get install -y gcc-9 g++-9.
```

#### FFmpeg

FFmpeg is installed to handle video processing, encoding, and decoding, while on NVIDIA platforms, it is built with GPU support to accelerate video processing using NVENC/NVDEC for faster performance and lower CPU usage.

```bash
cd $HOME/Downloads
git clone https://git.videolan.org/git/ffmpeg/nv-codec-headers.git
cd nv-codec-headers && sudo make install && cd â€“
wget https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-7.1.tar.xz
tar -xf ffmpeg-7.1.tar.xz && cd ffmpeg-7.1
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-nonfree --enable-cuda-nvcc --enable-libnpp --extra-cflags=-I/usr/local/cuda/include --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 --disable-static --enable-shared --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-gpl
make -j 12 && sudo make install
```

Using Python virtual environments ensures dependency isolation, preventing conflicts between different projects. The setup installs Python 3.11, essential AI/ML libraries (Ultralytics, OpenVINO, ONNX, MediaPipe), and video processing tools (AV, FFmpeg), optimizing the system for deep learning, computer vision, and real-time AI inference.

```bash
sudo mkdir /usr/local/mirasys && sudo mkdir /var/log/mirasys && sudo mkdir /home/mirasys
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /usr/local/mirasys && sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/log/mirasys && sudo chown $USER:$USER /home/mirasys
