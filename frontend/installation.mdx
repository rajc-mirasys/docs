## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Docker**: Docker must be installed and running (see guide below)
- **Administrator Mode**: You'll need administrator privileges to run some of the commands
- **Internet Connection**: An active internet connection is required to download the necessary docker images and dependencies.

<Tip>
  Ubuntu has a good terminal built-in but Windows's command prompt is very basic, so please download [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). This has features of tabs, and supports more Linux native commands that will be useful when interacting with it.
</Tip>

## One-file installation

Download `install_fe.sh` [script](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) file. Put the file in `~/Documents` folder, run following commands and it will install all the necessary libraries, python modules, make folders and give necessary permissions
```bash install_fe.sh
cd ~/Downloads && chmod u+x install_fe.sh && ./install_fe.sh
```

For your understanding, what the script installs, it's explanation of separate component is given below.

<Warning>
  If you're running the `install_fe.sh`, then running commands of this section is not required if the `install_fe.sh` installation went successfully. In case of failure, you can run the following commands separately.
</Warning>

### System Libraries

These commands install and configure Docker on Ubuntu, adding its official repository, verifying packages, and setting up the necessary runtime components. They also ensure non-root users can run Docker by adding them to the docker group, allowing seamless container management for our frontend system.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### Docker

#### What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that packages an application and everything it needs (code, libraries, settings) into a "container." This container can run on any computer with Docker installed, ensuring the app works the same everywhere.

#### How Does Docker Work?
- **Containers**: Lightweight, isolated environments that share the host computer‚Äôs OS but keep the app and its dependencies separate.
- **Docker Images**: Blueprints for containers. They include everything needed to run the app.
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions to build an image.
- **Docker Hub**: This is like an app store for Docker images. You can download pre-made images (like WordPress, MySQL, etc.) or upload your own.

#### Why use Docker?
- **Consistency**: Works the same on any machine.
- **Isolation**: Apps run independently.
- **Portability**: Easy to move between environments.
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight and fast.

Example:
Think of Docker as a lunchbox. You pack your meal (app) with all the utensils (dependencies) it needs. You can open it anywhere and eat the same way, no matter the kitchen (computer).

In short, Docker makes building, sharing, and running apps simple and reliable!

#### How to use Docker in our frontend system?

Before running the deployment, operators must request the required `zip` containing Docker files from the software team. This ensures they have the latest version of the application and dependencies for a smooth setup.

Once you have the necessary files, execute the following commands. These commands ensure a clean and fresh deployment of our frontend system. First, old configuration files (.env and docker-compose.yaml) are removed to prevent conflicts. Then, deploy.sh init-images pulls the required Docker images, and deploy.sh development sets up and starts the services in a development environment. Finally, create-tenant-db.sh initializes the database structure needed for multi-tenant support.:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
unzip mirasysfrontend.zip && cd mirasysfrontend

# Remove Existing Configuration Files
rm -f .env docker-compose.yaml

# Initialize Docker Images for Caching
sudo ./deploy.sh init-images

# Build and Deploy the Application
sudo ./deploy.sh development

# Migrate Databases
sudo ./create-tenant-db.sh
```

#### How to access the frontend system?

We configure the `/etc/hosts` file on each machine to map domain names to IP addresses (`127.0.0.1` for same machine and network IP for other machines), allowing the frontend system and its services to be accessed using human-readable names instead of IP addresses. This acts as a local Domain Name System (DNS) resolver, ensuring smooth communication between components without needing an external DNS server. It helps standardize access across different machines and avoids network dependency issues.

**How to Add Entries:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit `hosts` file">
    - **Linux & macOS**: 
        - Edit the file `hosts` by using command: `sudo vim /etc/hosts`.
        - Press `i` to enter insert mode. Then add the entries.
        - Press `Esc` to exit insert mode. Then type `:wq` to save and exit.
    - **Windows**: 
        - Open Notepad as an administrator.
        - Go to folder `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`.
        - Open the `hosts` file.
        - Add the entries, save, and exit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Entries">
    ```bash 
    127.0.0.1 phpmyadmin_mirasys.local
    127.0.0.1 mirasys_frontend_central.local
    127.0.0.1 mirasys_frnt.local
    127.0.0.1 mirasys_api_gateway.local
    127.0.0.1 mirasys_api_tenant_gateway.local
    127.0.0.1 mirasys_backend.local
    127.0.0.1 mirasys_stream.local
    127.0.0.1 traefik_mirasys.local
    127.0.0.1 rabbitmq.local
    127.0.0.1 infra.local
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access">
    - Go to a Google Chrome browser (prefered) and type [http://mirasys_frnt.local](http://mirasys_frnt.local) to access the frontend system.
